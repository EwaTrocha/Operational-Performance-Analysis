# Operational Performance Analysis - AdventureWorks



This project analyzes the operational performance of the AdventureWorks company to identify bottlenecks, problems, and opportunities for improvement, focusing on production, suppliers, quality, inventory, and costs.

## Data Analytics Process

- **Objective**: Identify areas for improvement in:
  - Production process
  - Supplier performance
  - Quality control
  - Inventory management
  - Cost analysis

- **Data**: AdventureWorks database, analyzing tables related to production, suppliers, and inventory.

- **Metrics Analyzed**:
  1. **Production**: 
     - Production value/time, cost over time, total produced items
     - Avg. lead time, on-time production, production delays
  2. **Supplier Performance**:
     - Rejected items, vendor performance, lead time, purchase value
  3. **Quality**:
     - Production yield, defect rate, scrap reasons, defect cost
  4. **Inventory**:
     - Total items, value, unsold items (NSA), value of NSA
  5. **Cost Analysis**:
     - Profit, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), price of goods sold, profit margins

- **Key Insights**:
  1. **Production**: Production peaked early but slowed; average cost reduced but rising again. 42% of work orders are deleted, and average delay time is 6 days.
  2. **Supplier Performance**: $50M in purchases, $2M in rejected items. 
  3. **Quality**: Defect rates are low but increasing, with most defects occurring in sub-assembly and final assembly stages.
  4. **Inventory**: 85K products in stock worth $20M, with $8M in unsold items.
  5. **Cost Analysis**: COGS is $100M, and profit has decreased since June 2002. 19% of products sold do not generate profit.

- **Recommendations**:
  1. **Production**: Investigate deleted work orders and potential supply chain delays. Monitor rising production costs.
  2. **Supplier Performance**: Replace poor-performing vendors and negotiate better deals.
  3. **Quality**: Allocate resources to training or equipment recalibration for defect-prone processes.
  4. **Inventory**: Address unsold products via promotions or clearance to free warehouse space.
  5. **Cost Analysis**: Investigate unprofitable products, consider removing low-profit items, and renegotiate supplier terms where applicable.
